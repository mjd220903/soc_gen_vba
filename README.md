# VBA Macro Documentation and Transformation Automation

## Overview

This project provides a solution for automating the documentation and transformation of VBA macros from Excel files. It extracts VBA code from Excel files, saves it to separate files, generates documentation in markdown format, and applies simple transformations to the VBA code.

## Architecture

The solution consists of a single Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. **Extract VBA Code**: Uses the `pywin32` library to interact with Excel and extract VBA code from modules.
2. **Save VBA Code**: Saves the extracted VBA code to separate files for each module.
3. **Generate Documentation**: Creates a markdown file documenting the extracted VBA code.
4. **Transform VBA Code**: Applies simple transformations to the VBA code and saves the transformed code to separate files.

## Directory Structure

.
├── extracted_vba_code          # Directory where the extracted VBA code files will be saved
├── transformed_vba_code        # Directory where the transformed VBA code files will be saved
├── vba_documentation.md        # Generated documentation file
├── vba_automation.py           # Main Python script
└── README.md                   # This readme file


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Excel with VBA macros
- Required Python libraries:
  - pywin32

## Setup

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install pywin32**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   pip install pywin32

3. **Download the Script**: Save the `vba_automation.py` script to your local directory.

4. **Modify the Script**: Update the `file_path` variable in the script to point to your Excel file with VBA macros:

   file_path = "path_to_your_excel_file.xlsm"
   

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and run:

   python vba_automation.py

2. **Output**: 
   - The extracted VBA code will be saved in the `extracted_vba_code` directory.
   - The transformed VBA code will be saved in the `transformed_vba_code` directory.
   - The documentation will be generated in the `vba_documentation.md` file.

## Script Details

### Extract VBA Code

The script uses the `win32com.client` library to interact with Excel and extract VBA code from the specified workbook. The extracted code is stored in a dictionary with module names as keys and code as values.

### Save VBA Code

The extracted VBA code is saved to individual files in the `extracted_vba_code` directory. Each file is named after the corresponding module.

### Generate Documentation

The script generates a markdown file (`vba_documentation.md`) that documents the extracted VBA code. Each module's code is included in a separate section of the markdown file.

### Transform VBA Code

The script applies simple transformations to the VBA code, such as adding comments, and saves the transformed code to individual files in the `transformed_vba_code` directory.

## Example Output

### Extracted VBA Code (extracted_vba_code/Module1.vba)

Sub HelloWorld()
    MsgBox "Hello, world!"
End Sub

### Transformed VBA Code (transformed_vba_code/Module1.vba)

' Transformed VBA Code
Sub HelloWorld()
    MsgBox "Hello, world!"
End Sub
```

### Documentation (vba_documentation.md)
```markdown
# VBA Macro Documentation

## Module: Module1

Sub HelloWorld()
    MsgBox "Hello, world!"
End Sub

## Conclusion

This solution automates the extraction, documentation, and transformation of VBA macros from Excel files, making it easier to manage and understand VBA code.
